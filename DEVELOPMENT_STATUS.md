# Arcium Encrypted Opinion Platform - Development Status

## Project Goal
Transform the existing Arcium MPC voting/survey platform into a full decentralized encrypted opinion platform where users can:
- **Post encrypted opinions anonymously** on various topics
- **Comment on opinions** while remaining anonymous
- **Provide encrypted feedback** with MPC-aggregated ratings
- **Maintain full privacy** with Arcium's confidential computing

## Current Status: ⚠️ In Progress

### ✅ Completed
1. **Encrypted Instructions (MPC Circuits)**
   - Voting polls (yes/no) - ✅ Working
   - Opinion surveys (1-5 ratings) - ✅ Working
   - All encrypted instructions compile successfully

2. **Solana Program - Existing Features**
   - Vote submission and tallying
   - Opinion survey aggregation
   - MPC callbacks for result reveals
   - Events for vote/opinion submissions

### 🚧 In Progress
1. **New Features Being Added**
   - Opinion post creation (encrypted title, content, topic)
   - Comment system (encrypted comments on posts)
   - Feedback aggregation for posts

2. **Current Blockers**
   - Compilation errors in Solana program due to missing callback types
   - Need to properly integrate new structs with Arcium's macro system
   - Account struct definitions commented out temporarily

### 📋 Architecture Design

#### Opinion Posts
```rust
pub struct OpinionPostAccount {
    post_id: u64,
    encrypted_title: [u8; 32],      // Encrypted via Arcium
    encrypted_content: [u8; 128],    // Encrypted via Arcium
    encrypted_topic: [u8; 16],       // Encrypted via Arcium
    author: Pubkey,                  // Can be anonymous PDA
    created_at: i64,
    total_comments: u32,
    total_feedback: u32,
}
```

#### Comments
```rust
pub struct CommentAccount {
    comment_id: u64,
    post_id: u64,
    encrypted_content: [u8; 64],     // Encrypted comment
    author: Pubkey,                  // Anonymous
    created_at: i64,
}
```

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Fix Compilation Issues**
   - Remove references to non-existent feedback MPC instructions (init_feedback_stats, submit_feedback, reveal_feedback_stats)
   - These were placeholder designs that don't have corresponding encrypted instructions
   - Clean up commented code

2. **Implement Core Opinion Features**
   - Uncomment and fix `create_opinion_post` instruction
   - Uncomment and fix `add_comment` instruction
   - Use existing Solana storage (not MPC) for posts/comments since content is already encrypted client-side

3. **Privacy Architecture**
   - Client-side encryption of opinion content before submission
   - Use Arcium MPC only for aggregations (ratings, statistics)
   - Anonymous PDAs for author identities
   - No on-chain decryption of individual posts/comments

4. **Testing & Deployment**
   - Fix all compilation errors
   - Run `arcium test`
   - Deploy with `arcium deploy --cluster-offset <offset>`
   - Build frontend UI

### 💡 Key Insights

**What Works with Arcium MPC:**
- Aggregating encrypted votes (yes/no tallies)
- Aggregating encrypted ratings (1-5 averages)
- Statistical computations without revealing individual data

**What Doesn't Need MPC:**
- Storing encrypted text content (posts, comments)
- These can be encrypted client-side and stored on-chain
- MPC is for computations, not storage

**Correct Approach:**
1. Users encrypt opinion posts/comments client-side
2. Store encrypted blobs on Solana (like OpinionPostAccount)
3. Use MPC only for ratings/feedback aggregation
4. Maintain anonymity through PDA author addresses
